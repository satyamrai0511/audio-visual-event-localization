# 🎯 Audio-Visual Event Localization in Videos

A research-driven project to design an **autoregressive model** that integrates both **audio** and **video** signals for **temporal event localization**. By aligning auditory and visual streams, the goal is to detect and classify meaningful events more precisely.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Build an end-to-end multimodal event localization pipeline.
- Leverage autoregressive modeling to capture temporal dependencies.
- Fuse audio-visual features using attention or cross-modal interaction.
- Achieve accurate event classification and localization in videos.

## 🚀 Usage (Coming Soon)

```bash
python src/inference.py --video data/sample_video.mp4 --audio data/sample_audio.wav
```

Example output:

```
Detected Event: "Clapping" from 00:15 to 00:19
Detected Event: "Door Slam" from 01:02 to 01:03
```

## 🧠 Model Architecture (Planned)

- **Audio Encoder**: Pretrained CNN or transformer-based AST
- **Video Encoder**: CLIP/ViT or 3D CNN
- **Fusion Module**: Cross-attention or multimodal transformer
- **Temporal Model**: Autoregressive decoder for event sequence prediction

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Average Precision (mAP)
- Localization Accuracy (IoU-based)
- F1-Score per event type

---

## 🧪 Future Work

- [ ] Real-time streaming support
- [ ] Web UI for uploading and testing video/audio files
- [ ] Integration with pretrained multimodal transformers
